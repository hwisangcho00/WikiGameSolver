Project Name: Wiki Game Solver
Description of project:

"The Wiki Game" is an online game where you compete with other people to reach to a goal wikipedia page from a start
wikipedia page by only clicking through the hyperlinks available within each page. This program is designed to find and
print the path from the given start page to the goal page. You will be given the choice of using breadth first search
or tf-idf method to find a viable path. After inputting both start page and end page, the program will dynamically
find a path for you! (You can try to play this game from this link : https://www.thewikigame.com/group)

This project touches upon "Graph and graph algorithm" and "Document Search." If you choose to use BFS to find a path,
the program will search upon all link that exists within a page and add links to queue and the visited array. However,
to improve efficiency of the program, it is a modified version of BFS where link is added to the queue if it shares the
same category as the target wikipedia page. If such a link does not exist, it randomly chooses a link and continues the
BFS procedure. If you choose the tf-idf version, the program will automatically preprocess the html's text and find the
term frequency. Then, by comparing each link with target page, it picks the link with the highest cosine similarity and
continues the search.

A fun way to test this program is to access https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Random this page.
Choose a random article -> Copy its title and run the program it as an input

(I have modified the Corpus, VectorSpaceModel, Document class from homework 4 to implement to tf-idf
functionality. It has been modified to match the Wikipedia web page compared to the .txt input file)
